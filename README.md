# Exploring-DNA-secondary-structures-with-Python
In this repository you will find two notebooks and codes that might help you predict where DNA secondary structures are most likely to be found within any genome using Python dependencies.
I used  some of the codes found in this notebook for my dissertation project thesis. 



*Disclaimer, some of these codes where inspired by examples available online and modified accordingly.
