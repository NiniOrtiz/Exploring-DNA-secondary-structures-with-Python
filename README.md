# Exploring-DNA-secondary-structures-with-Python
In this repository you will find two notebooks and codes that might help you predict where DNA secondary structures are most likely to be found within any genome using Python dependencies.
I used  some of the codes found in this notebook for my dissertation project thesis. 

+ You will learn how to search secondary dna structures in a genome . You will learn how to use a sliding window analysis to compare the folding energy of each window with the number of deletions that can be found at this window.
+ You will learn how to calculate the shannon entropy of the DNA Multiple alignment of a predicted DNA secondary structure to gauge if this sequence is either conserved or not.



*Disclaimer, some of these codes where inspired by examples available online and modified accordingly.

Thank you! For checking this out =)
